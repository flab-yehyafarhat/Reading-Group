# Learning to Solve Optimization Problems with Hard Linear Constraints

Constrained optimization problems appear in a wide variety
of challenging real-world problems, where constraints often
capture the physics of the underlying system. Classic methods
for solving these problems rely on iterative algorithms
that explore the feasible domain in the search for the best solution.
These iterative methods are often the computational
bottleneck in decision-making and adversely impact timesensitive
applications. Recently, neural approximators have
shown promise as a replacement for the iterative solvers that
can output the optimal solution in a single feed-forward providing
rapid solutions to optimization problems. However,
enforcing constraints through neural networks remains an
open challenge. This paper develops a neural approximator
that maps the inputs to an optimization problem with hard
linear constraints to a feasible solution that is nearly optimal.
Our proposed approach consists of four main steps: 1) reducing
the original problem to optimization on a set of independent
variables, 2) finding a gauge function that maps the `1-
norm unit ball to the feasible set of the reduced problem, 3)
learning a neural approximator that maps the optimization’s
inputs to an optimal point in the `1-norm unit ball, and 4)
find the values of the dependent variables from the independent
variable and recover the solution to the original problem.
We can guarantee hard feasibility through this sequence
of steps. Unlike the current learning-assisted solutions, our
method is free of parameter-tuning and removes iterations altogether.
We demonstrate the performance of our proposed
method in quadratic programming in the context of the optimal
power dispatch (critical to the resiliency of our electric
grid) and a constrained non-convex optimization in the context
of image registration problems. Our results support our
theoretical findings and demonstrate superior performance in
terms of computational time, optimality, and the feasibility of
the solution compared to existing approaches

# End-to-End Feasible Optimization Proxies for Large-Scale Economic Dispatch

The paper proposes a novel End-to-End Learning
and Repair (E2ELR) architecture for training optimization
proxies for economic dispatch problems. E2ELR combines deep
neural networks with closed-form, differentiable repair layers,
thereby integrating learning and feasibility in an end-to-end
fashion. E2ELR is also trained with self-supervised learning,
removing the need for labeled data and the solving of numerous
optimization problems offline. E2ELR is evaluated on industrysize
power grids with tens of thousands of buses using an economic
dispatch that co-optimizes energy and reserves. The results
demonstrate that the self-supervised E2ELR achieves state-ofthe-
art performance, with optimality gaps that outperform other
baselines by at least an order of magnitude.

# End-to-End Learning to Warm-Start for Real-Time Quadratic Optimization
First-order methods are widely used to solve convex quadratic programs (QPs) in
real-time applications because of their low per-iteration cost. However, they can suffer
from slow convergence to accurate solutions. In this paper, we present a framework
which learns an effective warm-start for a popular first-order method in real-time applications, Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting, across a family of parametric QPs. This
framework consists of two modules: a feedforward neural network block, which takes
as input the parameters of the QP and outputs a warm-start, and a block which performs a fixed number of iterations of DR splitting from this warm-start and outputs
a candidate solution. A key feature of our framework is its ability to do end-to-end
learning as we differentiate through the DR iterations. To illustrate the effectiveness
of our method, we provide generalization bounds (based on Rademacher complexity)
that improve with the number of training problems and number of iterations simultaneously. We further apply our method to three real-time applications and observe
that, by learning good warm-starts, we are able to significantly reduce the number of
iterations required to obtain high-quality solutions.

# Fast, Differentiable and Sparse Top-k: a Convex Analysis Perspective
The top-k operator returns a k-sparse vector, where the non-zero values correspond to the k
largest values of the input. Unfortunately, because it is a discontinuous function, it is difficult to
incorporate in neural networks trained end-to-end with backpropagation. Recent works have
considered differentiable relaxations, based either on regularization or perturbation techniques.
However, to date, no approach is fully differentiable and sparse. In this paper, we propose new
differentiable and sparse top-k operators. We view the top-k operator as a linear program over
the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations. We then introduce a p-norm regularization
term to smooth out the operator, and show that its computation can be reduced to isotonic
optimization. Our framework is significantly more general than the existing one and allows for
example to express top-k operators that select values in magnitude. On the algorithmic side,
in addition to pool adjacent violator (PAV) algorithms, we propose a new GPU/TPU-friendly
Dykstra algorithm to solve isotonic optimization problems. We successfully use our operators
to prune weights in neural networks, to fine-tune vision transformers, and as a router in sparse
mixture of experts.
