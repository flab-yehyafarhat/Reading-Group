#Learning to Solve Optimization Problems with Hard Linear Constraints

Abstract
Constrained optimization problems appear in a wide variety
of challenging real-world problems, where constraints often
capture the physics of the underlying system. Classic methods
for solving these problems rely on iterative algorithms
that explore the feasible domain in the search for the best solution.
These iterative methods are often the computational
bottleneck in decision-making and adversely impact timesensitive
applications. Recently, neural approximators have
shown promise as a replacement for the iterative solvers that
can output the optimal solution in a single feed-forward providing
rapid solutions to optimization problems. However,
enforcing constraints through neural networks remains an
open challenge. This paper develops a neural approximator
that maps the inputs to an optimization problem with hard
linear constraints to a feasible solution that is nearly optimal.
Our proposed approach consists of four main steps: 1) reducing
the original problem to optimization on a set of independent
variables, 2) finding a gauge function that maps the `1-
norm unit ball to the feasible set of the reduced problem, 3)
learning a neural approximator that maps the optimizationâ€™s
inputs to an optimal point in the `1-norm unit ball, and 4)
find the values of the dependent variables from the independent
variable and recover the solution to the original problem.
We can guarantee hard feasibility through this sequence
of steps. Unlike the current learning-assisted solutions, our
method is free of parameter-tuning and removes iterations altogether.
We demonstrate the performance of our proposed
method in quadratic programming in the context of the optimal
power dispatch (critical to the resiliency of our electric
grid) and a constrained non-convex optimization in the context
of image registration problems. Our results support our
theoretical findings and demonstrate superior performance in
terms of computational time, optimality, and the feasibility of
the solution compared to existing approaches
